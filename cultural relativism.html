    <h1> what is cultural relativism </h1>

    <img src="images/3.jpg" alt="">
    <p style="color: black;"> Cultural relativism is the idea that a person's beliefs, values, and practices should be understood based on that person's own culture, and
not be judged against the criteria of another. It was established as axiomatic in anthropological research by Franz Boas in the first few decades of the 20th century
and later popularized by his students. Boas first articulated the idea in 1887: "civilization is not something absolute, but...is relative, and...our ideas and 
conceptions are true only so far as our civilization goes."[2] However, Boas did not coin the term.The first use of the term recorded in the Oxford English Dictionary
was by philosopher and social theorist Alain Locke in 1924 to describe Robert Lowie's "extreme cultural relativism," found in the latter's 1917 book Culture and 
Ethnology.[3] The term became common among anthropologists after Boas' death in 1942, to express their synthesis of a number of ideas Boas had developed.
Boas believed that the sweep of cultures, to be found in connection with any subspecies, is so vast and pervasive that there cannot be a relationship between 
culture and race.[4] Cultural relativism involves specific epistemological and methodological claims. Whether or not these claims necessitate a specific ethical
stance is a matter of debate.
    
    <h2>Advantages of cultural relativism</h2>
    
<p> It creates a society where equality is possible.In any society, people rise by climbing on top of other people. It is a socially acceptable way of creating
discrimination. We see this today in the wage gap that women face, the educational opportunities that minority groups face, and the violence we see because 
of political oppression. Cultural relativism allows the individual to define their moral code without defining the moral code of others. Each person is separate
in such a society. That separation creates equality because each person can set their own definition of success. People can pursue a genuine interest.In the 
modern society, people are funneled toward certain career options because of their circumstances. If you can’t afford to go to college, then you pursue a 
vocational career or some sort of entrepreneurship instead of a career that requires a graduate degree. If you can’t afford to buy a house, you go rent an
apartment. In cultural relativism, you get to pursue your own interests without restriction. You set the definitions of what you can have and what you cannot
have. When implemented successfully, each person would get to focus on their strengths instead of their weaknesses.

    <h3> practice of cultural relativism in Ethiopia </h3>
<p> <img src="03.jpg" width="50%" ></p>
<p> Ethiopia, with its diversity of culture and fast economic growth, is one of the strongly driven countries in Africa. In the past ten years, Ethiopia’s GDP’s growth
rate has been an average of 10%.  The country’s renaissance was propelled when it introduced the Growth and Transformation Plan (GTP) in 2010. The objective of this
plan is to jump-start the pace of the dynamism of the country. Through the first GTP, which lasts for 5 years, significant results are achieved in developing 
infrastructures in all aspects. To mention few, road construction and telecommunication are some of the highest achievements of the GTP. The Federal Democratic
Republic of Ethiopia’s constitution article 41(9) and article 91(3) precisely show the government duties and responsibilities to protect, preserve and support
the cultural heritages and arts. The constitution highlights the importance of the diversity of cultural expressions in Ethiopia since 1994.  Cognizant of the
fact that all policies, measures and international agreements ratified by Ethiopia are proven to agree with the constitutional pillars, the upper mentioned
and other various articles pledged in favor of the cultural expressions have gotten ample opportunities and conducive platform both to be underpinned by
policies and dignified.As the second GTP starts, Ethiopia, is now investing in the development of its lively cultural sector.  Ethiopia has now incorporated
culture as a strategic element for the second GTP and for the first time dedicated an entire chapter for the cultural sector, setting up benchmarked goals
for the implementation. This move reaffirms Ethiopia’s dedication and the importance of the link between culture and development
